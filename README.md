# Technical details
1. Fabricated using Plywood- 5 mm thickness
2. Microcontroller used -Arduino Uno
3. A total of 4 servo motors used.
4. Power supply used - ATX Power supply unit (PSU)- A very reliable high wattage power supply. 12 V voltage output of PSU is converted to 6 V using LM2596 buck converter.
5. Inverse Kinematics computed using MATLAB (Peter Corke's robotics toolbox).
6. Base of the robot designed in Fusion 360.
