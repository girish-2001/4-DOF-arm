# 4-DOF-arm
A four degree of freedom generic robotic arm for pick and place applications
This project was built in the summer of 2020 for RMI Inductions. The robot was designed and built in a period of one month. 

Technical details:
1. Fabricated using Plywood- 5 mm thickness
2. Microcontroller used -Arduino Uno
3. A total of 4 servo motors used.
4. Power supply used - ATX Power supply unit (PSU)- A very reliable high wattage power supply. 12 V voltage output of PSU is converted to 6 V using a buck converter.
5. Inverse Kinematics computed using MATLAB (Peter Corke's robotics toolbox).
6. Base of the robot designed in Fusion 360.
